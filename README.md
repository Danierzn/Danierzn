# Keyboard-Soldering
  &emsp; This was a project I created in Grade 12. I found inspiration off of the unique characteristic of the Arduino microcontroller where it possesses the 
  [**ATmega32U4**](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega32U4)
microchip technology which can be used to create a fully functioning keyboard peripheral for a computer. I started to get into the world of keyboard building,
so for my first experience, I decided to go the more difficult route. 

 &emsp; Instead of picking different components such as a pcb, case, switches, keycaps, for a general keyboard build; I wanted to create my own keyboard from scratch
 using just the switches and keycaps my classmate had spares of, and used the Arduino Micro, soldering, and scrap pieces of wood to attempt on creating a fully functional
 handwired keyboard.
